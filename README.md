# AlgoX
AlgoX is an app that adds algorithmic trading and backtesting to the stock market game. 

## Quickstart
1. Create an account or sign in*
3. Try searching so your favorite stock tickers (EX: Apple- AAPL, Tesla- TSLA, Microsoft- MSFT) in the search page to view the stocks performance and company statistics
4. To backtest or set a new algorithm to run in real time head to the backtesting page. Here you can choose an rule for buying and selling, set paramaters, a ticker, and a timeframe 
5. Hit "Run" to run the back-testing and evaluate the performance of your algorithm. 
6. From this page, you can choose whether you'd like to set this algorithm to run in real time with a certain amount of money. Otherwise, you can go back and try a different algorithm.
